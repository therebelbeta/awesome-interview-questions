# Awesome Interview Questions

Looking for a job? Been burned in the past? Have you ever gotten what you thought would be a great job to find out later you sold your soul to the Devil? Ever get laid off after 3 months because whoever hired you didn't tell you they only needed people for a big short term project?

Here are some questions you can ask of your potential employer.

See if they're arrogant. You want to be sure they're open to new ideas.
- What open source packages do you use? If they don't have not invented here syndrome they're probably not that arrogant. They'll be able to see someone else's idea is good.
-

What frameworks and tools do they use?
- Backend
- Frontend
- Styling
- Dependency management tools like Composer (PHP), npm (NodeJS), pip (Python), Bower (frontend), Yeoman (frontend), etc.

See what kind of work you'll be doing:
- What browsers do you support?
- Do you do mobile websites and apps?
- Do you publish any open source projects? Can you give me links?

Send me some code samples.
- CSS
- a template file
- backend code
- Javascript

See if they use a content versioning system and how they use it. If they don't just walk away.
- What system do you use? Git, SVN, Mercurial?
- What branches do you use? Naming conventions and purposes?
- Do you use Continuous Delivery/Integration/Deployment?
    - Continuous delivery is commiting constantly to a shared development branch.
    - Integration is running automated tests constantly.
    - Deployment is constanly deploying your code to staging or production environments.

How do you do deployments?
- Schedule a certain date and time? If so what?
- Use a deployment tool?
- Are there rules for who gets to deploy and when?

Make sure you job is secuire:
- Is your company profitable?
- Have you ever laid anyone off before? How many people? When?

Check on their security measures:
- Do you store any sensitve data? Emails, passwords, social security numbers, credit card numbers?
- How do you secure that data, if any?
- What database abstraction layer do you use?
- See if they know what an SQL injection attack is. Don't ask them directly. Ask if they use a database abstraction layer and see if they know why they are supposed to.
- What other security measures do you use? See if they try to prevent things like stealing data, cross site scripting, etc.

Check backgrounds of the company and any employees you'll be working with:
- Go to http://glassdoor.com and check the company profile. See what current and past employees have said about their experience. If there are a lot of
negative comments that are very consistent in subject matter: that's a BIG RED FLAG. Note that usually a company has to be pretty big and be around for
a while to get a good amount of reviews.
- Check the company website and see if they have any employees listed. A lot of companies these days have profile pics of all their employees. You can run background checks on them from there.
- Look up company employees on LinkedIn. Especially your team. Are they all the same gender, age, and race? If so it might be a red flag.
- Google them and see what customers, employees, and former employees say. glassdoor.com for example. If they're fairly large and have been around a while you should be able to find something. Google things like "Company X Sucks" too.
- Google the people on the team. Who you'll be working for. Check their Facebook and Twitter. See if they have any red flags. Arrests, obscene posts? Run background checks if you can.
- If you have access see if they have a criminal background. Companies do it why can't you? See if anyone has arrests for bad driving, drug possession, DUIs, assaulting a female, or anything else.

If they have a coding challenge make sure of the following:
- Are they having you write an application they can use? That's called brain rape. That's where a company gets free work and ideas from potential job candidates. What they're asking you shouldn't be useful to their business.
- Brain rape can also come from asking too many detailed questions about technical solutions to real world problems they have. Trying to get free consulting work.
- Is it strangely difficult? Could be a sign they're arrogant. Just want to make the hardest test possible to reject anyone for any reason (gender, race, weight, etc) or make themselves feel better that they are "better" than all the candidates they reject.
- Are they asking you to demonstrate reasonable skills that are up to date? Are they asking for Flash or Angular? Not Invented Here Syndrome?
- Are they asking for relative marketable skills? Do you have to write a Javascritp drop and drop system using no 3rd party libraries? Or do you have some freedom to use the tools you want?

Is it an ambush interview where they throw 10 people at you for an entire day? Asking random questions and being really abrasive and confrontational. Are the questions these asinine brain teasers?
